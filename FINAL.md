### Changes
There were a lot of changes. At first, I didn't think about a platform class but then I realized it might be crucial in getting my game to work. Also I added a score counter that 
wasn't in my original plan, just a last minute feature. Also added some visual feedback signifying how many lives and what your score was. Also fixed many bugs regarding the ball
bouncing off the paddle.

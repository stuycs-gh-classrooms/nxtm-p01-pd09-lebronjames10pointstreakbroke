### Overview
Your mission is create either:
- Life-like cellular automata [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), [life-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-like_cellular_automaton), [demo](https://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#https://www.netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/Sample%20Models/Computer%20Science/Cellular%20Automata/Life.nlogo).
- Breakout/Arkanoid [demo 0](https://elgoog.im/breakout/)  [demo 1](https://www.crazygames.com/game/atari-breakout)
- Space Invaders/Galaga

This project will be completed in phases.  
The first phase will be to work on this document. 
* Use markdown formatting.

## Phase 0: Selection, Analysis & Plan

#### Selected Project: Breakout

### Necessary Features
What are the core features that your program should have? These should be things that __must__ be implemented in order to make the program useable/playable, not extra features that could be added to make the program more interesting/fun.

Adding a platform that can be moved using the mouse. Have a grid of blocks that a ball can hit. MUST HAVE A BALL that can bounce off walls, platform, and blocks. Once it hits 
a block, the block gets destroyed. Lose when the ball goes down to the void. Adding a lives mechanism, pause/play mechanism, and reset mechanism.

### Extra Features
What are some features that are not essential to the program, but you would like to see (provided you have time after completing the necessary features. Theses can be customizations that are not part of the core requirements.

Adding new levels, make the paddle (platform) to change color whenever the ball hits it, Make the ball go faster each time it hits the paddle (with a speed limit of course). Blocks with higher health than other blocks.

### Array Usage
How will you be using arrays in this project?

1D Array:
- color[] colors  - stores the available colors for blocks (red, green, blue)
- 

2D Array:
- Blocks[][] grid - creates and manages the grid of blocks 


### Controls
How will your program be controlled? List all keyboard commands and mouse interactions.

Keyboard Commands:
- r = reset
- spacebar = pause/unpause

  

Mouse Control:
- Mouse movement: Move the mouse to get the platform moving



### Classes
What classes will you be creating for this project? Include the instance variables and methods that you believe you will need. You will be required to create at least 2 different classes. If you are going to use classes similar to those we've made for previous assignments, you will have to add new features to them.

CLASS NAME0: Blocks
- Instance variables:
  - int w
  - int h
  - color colour
  - Pvector center
- METHODS
  - void display()

CLASS NAME1: Projetile
- Instance variables:
  - int lives
  - int size
  - color colour
  - Pvector center
  - Pvector velocity 
- METHODS
  - void display()
  - boolean collisionCheck(Blocks other)
  - void move()
CLASS NAME2: Platform
- Instance variables:
  - PVector pos
  - PVector size
  - color colour
- METHODS
  - void display()
  - void update()
